## Introduction

This project showcases the simplicity of using Firebase for authentication and authorization in Go. 

## Why Firebase for Authentication in Go?


- **Ease of Integration**: Firebase's Go client library makes it straightforward to integrate Firebase authentication into your Go .
- **Multiple Authentication Methods**: Firebase supports various authentication methods, including email/password, phone, and social logins, making it versatile for different user bases.
- **Security**: Firebase handles the heavy lifting of security, including token management and encryption, ensuring that your application remains secure.
- **Scalability**: Firebase's infrastructure is designed to scale automatically, making it suitable for applications of all sizes.
- **Real-time Database**: Firebase's real-time database allows for easy data synchronization across clients, enhancing the user experience.

## What This Project Solves

This project addresses the challenge of securely authenticating and authorizing users in Go using Firebase. It demonstrates how to:

- **Authenticate Users**: Use the Firebase Go client to authenticate users from the browser or a client application.
- **Verify Tokens**: Validate Firebase tokens to ensure they are legitimate and have not been tampered with.
- **Manage User Sessions**: Implement secure user sessions to maintain user state across multiple requests.
- **Authorize Access**: Control access to resources based on user roles and permissions.


## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Install the Firebase Go Client**: Ensure you have the Firebase Go client installed in your Go environment.
2. **Set Up Firebase Project**: Create a new Firebase project or use an existing one.
3. **Configure Authentication**: Set up the desired authentication methods in the Firebase console.
4. **Integrate Firebase Go Client**: Follow the project's documentation to integrate the Firebase Go client into your Go application.
5. **Clone the git repo**: ```git clone https://github.com/Cprime50/Fire-Go```
6. **Obtain Your Firebase Private Key**:
   - Navigate to the Firebase Console and download your project's private key , this will be a JSON file.
   - For security, it's recommended to store this key in a `.env` file.

7. **Create .env file**:**Create a `.env` File**:
   - In the root directory of the project, create a `.env` file.
   - Add the following details to the `.env` file:
```
ADMIN_EMAIL= youremail@mail.com

PORT=:3000

FIREBASE_KEY= your_private_key.json
```
*Note**: Replace `youremail@mail.com` with your admin email, and `path/to/your_private_key.json` with the actual path to your downloaded Firebase private key.

- **Admin Email**: This email will be set as the default admin when authenticated, assuming it doesn't already have an assigned role.
- **Port**: Specifies the port on which your server will run.
- **Firebase Key**: The path to your Firebase private key file, which is essential for authenticating with Firebase services.
